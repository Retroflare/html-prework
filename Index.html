      <p>I was born and raised in Jamaica, a vibrant and culturally rich island in the Caribbean. From a young age, I developed a deep passion for architecture, which led me to pursue a degree in Architectural Studies during my time at university. The experience of studying architecture allowed me to explore my creativity and develop a keen eye for design.

         embarked on an exciting journey to the United States, seeking new opportunities and challenges. However, my passion for sports remained a significant part of my life. During my college years back home in Jamaica, I excelled as both a track star and a soccer player. I dedicated countless hours to training and honing my skills, dreaming of a professional career in sports.
        
        Unfortunately, injuries intervened, hindering my path to becoming a professional athlete. Although it was a setback, these challenges only fueled my determination to explore other avenues and channel my passion in different ways. It was during this time that I discovered my unwavering dedication to architecture and design.
        
        With a blend of my architectural knowledge, creative mindset, and the resilience forged through my sporting experiences, I am now equipped to tackle the diverse and dynamic challenges of the design world</p>
